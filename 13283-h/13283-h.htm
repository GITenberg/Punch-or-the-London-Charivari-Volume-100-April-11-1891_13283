    <h2>MR. PUNCH'S PRIZE NOVELS.</h2>

    <h3>No. XVI.&mdash;GERMFOOD.</h3>

    <h4>(<i>By</i> MARY MORALLY, <i>Author of "Ginbitters!"
    "Ardart," &amp;c., &amp;c.</i>)</h4>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[The MS. of this remarkable novel was tied round with
        scarlet ribbons, and arrived in a case which had been once
        used for the packing of bottles of rum, or some other
        potent spirit. It is dedicated in highly uncomplimentary
        terms to "<i>Messieurs les Marronneurs glacés de
        Paris</i>." With it came a most extraordinary letter, from
        which we make, without permission, the following startling
        extracts. "Ha! Ha! likewise Fe Fo Fum. I smell blood,
        galloping, panting, whirling, hurling, throbbing, maddened
        blood. My brain is on fire, my pen is a flash of lightning.
        I see stars, three stars, that is to say, one of the best
        brands plucked from the burning. I'm going to make your
        flesh creep. I'll give you fits, paralytic fits, epileptic
        fits, and fits of hysteria, all at the same time. Have I
        ever been in Paris? Never. Do I know the taste of absinthe?
        How dare you ask me such a question? Am I a woman? Ask me
        another. Ugh! it's coming, the demon is upon me. I must
        write three murderous volumes. I must, I must! What was
        that shriek? and that? and that? Unhand me, snakes!
        Oh!!!!&mdash;M.M."]</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h4>CHAPTER I.</h4>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:60%;">
        <a href="images/169.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/169.png"
             alt="A leopard of the forest had issued from a side-street ..." />
        </a>
    </div>

    <p>I was asleep and dreaming&mdash;dreaming dreadful, horrible,
    soul-shattering dreams&mdash;dreams that flung me head-first
    out of bed, and then flung me back into bed off the uncarpeted
    floor of my chamber. But I did not wake&mdash;why should
    I?&mdash;it was unnecessary&mdash;I wanted to dream&mdash;I had
    to dream and therefore I dreamt. I was walking home from a
    cheap restaurant in one of the poorer quarters of Paris.
    "Poorer quarters" is a nice vague term. There are many poorer
    quarters in a large city. This was one of them. Let that
    suffice to the critical pedants who clamour for accuracy and
    local colour. Accuracy! pah! Shall the soaring soul of a
    three-volumer be restrained by the debasing fetters of a
    grovelling exactitude? Never! I will tell you what. If I
    choose, I who speak to you, <i>moi qui vous parle</i>, the
    Seine shall run red with the blood of murdered priests, and
    there shall be a tide in it where no tide ever was before,
    close to Paris itself, the home of the <i>Marrons Glacés</i>,
    and into the river I shall plunge a corpse with upturned face
    and glassy, staring, haunting, dreadful eyes, and the tide
    shall turn, the tide that never was on earth, or sky, or sea,
    it shall turn in my second volume for one night only, and carry
    the corpse of my victim back, back, back under bridges
    innumerable, back into the heart of Paris. Dreadful, isn't it?
    <i>Allons, mon ami. Qu'est-ce-qu'il-y-a. Je ne sais quoi. Mon
    Dieu!</i> There's idiomatic French for you, all sprinkled out
    of a cayenne pepper-pot to make the local colour hot and
    strong. Bah! let us return to our muttons!</p>

    <h4>CHAPTER II.</h4>

    <p>What was that? Something yellow, and spotted&mdash;something
    sinuous and lithe, with crawling, catlike motion. No, no! Yes,
    yes!! A leopard of the forest had issued from a side-street, a
    <i>cul de sac</i>, as the frivolous sons of Paris, the Queen of
    Vice, call it. It was moving with me, stopping when I stopped,
    galloping when I galloped, turning somersaults when I turned
    them. And then it spoke to me&mdash;spoke, yes, spoke, this
    thing of the desert&mdash;this wild phantasm of a brain
    distraught by over-indulgence in <i>marrons glacés</i>, the
    curse of <i>ma patrie</i>, and its speech was as the scent of
    scarlet poppies, plucked from the grave of a discarded
    mistress.</p>

    <p>"Thou shalt write," it said, "for it is thine to reform the
    world." I shuddered. The conversational "thou" is fearful at
    all times; but, ah, how true to nature, even the nature of a
    leopard of the forest. The beast continued&mdash;"But thou
    shalt write in English."</p>

    <p>"Spare me!" I ventured to interpose.</p>

    <p>"In English," it went on, inexorably&mdash;"in hysterical,
    sad, mad, bad English. And the tale shall be of
    France&mdash;France, where the ladies always leave the
    dinner-table before the men. Note this, and use it at page
    ninety of thy first volume. And thy French shall be worse than
    thy English, for thou shalt speak of a <i>frissonement</i>, and
    thy friends shall say, "<i>Nous blaguons le chose.</i>"</p>

    <p>"Stop!" I cried, in despair, "stop, fiend!&mdash;this is too
    much!" I sprang at the monster, and seized it by the throat.
    Our eyes, peering into each other's, seemed to ravage out, as
    by fire, the secrets hidden in our hearts. My blood hurled
    itself through my veins. There was something clamorous and wild
    in it. Then I fell prone on the ground, and remembered that I
    had eaten one <i>marron</i> for dinner. This explained
    everything, and I remembered no more till I came to myself, and
    found the divisional surgeon busily engaged upon me with a
    <i>pompe d'estomac</i>.</p>

    <h4>CHAPTER III.</h4>

    <p>My father, M. le Duc DI SPEPSION, belonged to one of the
    oldest French families. He had many old French customs, amongst
    others that of brushing his bearded lips against my cheek. He
    was a stern man, with a severe habit of addressing me as
    "<i>Mon fils</i>." Generally he disapproved of my proceedings,
    which was, perhaps, not unnatural, taking all the circumstances
    of the case into consideration. Why have I mentioned him? I
    know not, save that even now, degraded as I am, memories of
    better things sometimes steal over me like the solemn sound of
    church-bells pealing in a cathedral belfry. But I have done
    with home, with father, with patriotism, with claret, with
    walnuts, and with all simple pleasures. <i>Ça va sans dire.</i>
    They talk to me of Good, and Nature. The words are meaningless
    to me. Are there realities behind these words&mdash;realities
    that can touch the heart of a confirmed <i>marroneur</i>? Cold
    and pitiless, Nature sits aloft like a mathematician, with his
    balance regulating the storm-pulses of this troubled world.
    Bah! I fling myself in her teeth. I brazen it out. She quails.
    For, since the accursed food passed my lips, the strength of a
    million demons is in me. I am pitiless. I laugh to think of the
    fool I once was in the days when I fed myself on <i>Baba au
    Rhum</i>, and other innocent dishes. Now I have knowledge. I am
    my own good. I glance haughtily into&mdash;[Ten rhapsodical
    pages omitted.&mdash;ED. <i>Punch</i>.] But there came into my
    life a false priest, who was like the ghost of a fair lost
    god&mdash;and because he was a fair lost, the cabmen loved him
    not&mdash;and he had to die, and lie in the Morgue&mdash;the
    Morgue where murdered men and women love to dwell&mdash;and
    thus he should discover the Eternal Secret!</p>

    <h4>CHAPTER IV.</h4>

    <p>Again&mdash;again&mdash;again! The moon rose, shimmering
    like a <i>Marron Glacé</i> over Paris. Oh! Paris, beauteous
    city of the lost. Surely in Babylon or in Nineveh, where
    SEMIRAMIS of old queened it over men, never was such
    madness&mdash;madness did I say? Why? What did I mean? Tush!
    the struggle is over, and I am calm again, though my blood
    still hums tumultuously. The world is very evil. My father died
    choked by a <i>marron</i>. I, too, am dead&mdash;I who have
    written this rubbish&mdash;I am dead, and sometimes, as I walk,
    my loved one glides before me in aërial phantom shape, as on
    page 4, Vol. II. But I am dead&mdash;dead and buried&mdash;and
    over my grave an avenue of gigantic chestnuts reminds the
    passer-by of my fate: and on my tombstone it is written, "Here
    lies one who danced a cancan and ate <i>marrons glacés</i> all
    day. Be warned!" THE END.</p>

    <h2>LEAVES FROM A CANDIDATE'S DIARY.</h2>

    <h4>[CONTINUED.]</h4>

    <p><i>March 11</i>.&mdash;I shall have to be pretty careful in
    my speech to the Council. Must butter up Billsbury like fun.
    How would this do? "I am young, Gentlemen, but I should have
    studied the political history of my country to little purpose
    if I did not know that, up to the time of the last election,
    the vote of Billsbury was always cast on the side of
    enlightenment, and Constitutional progress. The rash and
    foolish experiments of those who sought to impair the glorious
    fabric of our laws and our Constitution found no favour in
    Billsbury. It was not your fault, I know, that this state of
    things has not been maintained, and that Billsbury is now
    groaning under the heavy burden of a distasteful
    representation. Far be it from me to say one word personally
    against the present Member for Billsbury. This is a political
    fight, and it is because his political opinions are mistaken
    that you have decided to attack him"&mdash;&amp;c., &amp;c.,
    &amp;c. Must throw in something about Conservatives being the
    true friends of working-men. CHUBSON is not an Eight Hours'
    man, so I can go a long way. What shall I say next? Church and
    State, of course, Ireland pacified and contented, glorious
    financial successes of present Government, steady removal of
    all legitimate grievances, and triumphs of our diplomacy in all
    parts of the world. Shall have to say a good word for
    Liberal-Unionists. TOLLAND says there are about thirty of them,
    all very touchy. Must try to work in the story of the boy and
    the plum-cake. It made them scream at the Primrose League
    meeting at Crowdale.</p>

    <p>By the way, Uncle HENRY said, "What about the Bar?" I told
    him I meant to keep on working at it&mdash;which won't be
    difficult if I don't get more work. I got just two Statements
    of Claim, and a Motion before a Judge in Chambers, all last
    year, the third year after my call. Sleepy. To bed.</p>

    <p><i>March 12</i>, <i>"George Hotel,"
    Billsbury</i>.&mdash;Left London by 2.15 to-day, and got to
    Billsbury at 5.30. TOLLAND met me at the station with half a
    dozen other "leaders of the Party." One was Colonel CHORKLE, a
    Volunteer Colonel; another was Alderman MOFFATT, a Scotchman
    with a very broad dialect. Then there was JERRAM, the Editor of
    the <i>Billsbury Standard</i>, "the organ of the Party in
    Billsbury," so TOLLAND said, and a couple of others. I was
    introduced to them all, and forgot which was which immediately
    afterwards, which was most embarrassing, as I had to address
    them all as "you," a want of distinction which I am afraid they
    felt. Tipped two porters, who carried my bag and rug, a
    shilling each. They looked knowing, but old TOLLAND had hinted
    that the other side had got a character for meanness of which
    we could take a perfectly proper advantage without in any way
    infringing the Corrupt Practices Act. Must look up that Act. It
    may be a help. From the station we went straight to the
    "George." There I was introduced to half a dozen more leaders
    of the Party. Can't remember one of them except BLISSOP, the
    Secretary of the Association, a chap about my own age, who told
    me his brother remembered me at Oxford. There was a fellow of
    that name, I think, who came up in my year, a scrubby-faced
    reading man. We made hay in his room after a Torpid "rag,"
    which he didn't like. Hope it isn't the same. I said I
    remembered him well. Dined with TOLLAND; nobody but leaders of
    the Party present, all as serious as judges, and full of
    importance. CHORKLE, who drops his "h's" frightfully, asked me
    "'ow long it would be afore a General Election," and seemed
    rather surprised when I said I had no information on the
    matter.</p>

    <p>The meeting of the Council came off in the large hall of the
    Billsbury Beaconsfield Club. TOLLAND was in the chair, and made
    a long speech in introducing me. I didn't take in a word of it,
    as I was repeating my peroration to myself all the time. My
    speech went off pretty well, except that I got mixed up in the
    middle, and forgot that blessed story. However, when I got into
    the buttering part, it took them by storm. I warmed old
    GLADSTONE up to-rights, and asked them to contrast the state of
    England now with what it was when he was in power. "Hyperion to
    a Satyr," I said. Colonel CHORKLE, in proposing afterwards that
    I was a fit and proper person to represent Billsbury, said,
    "Mr. PATTLE's able and convincing speech proves 'im not only a
    master of English, but a consummate orator, able to wield the
    harmoury" (why he put the "h" there I don't know) "of wit and
    sarcasm like a master. <i>I'm</i> not given to boasting," he
    continued. "<i>I</i> never indulge in badinage" (query,
    braggadocio?); "but, with such a Candidate, we <i>must</i>
    win." JERRAM seconded the resolution, which was carried <i>nem.
    con.</i> Must get local newspapers, to show to mother. She'll
    like that. Shall go back to London to-morrow.</p>

    <p><i>Nora</i> (<i>putting on a cloak and taking it off
    again</i>). Bother KROGSTAD! There, I won't think of him. I'll
    only think of the costume ball at Consul STENBORG's, over-head,
    to-night, where I am to dance the Tarantella all alone, dressed
    as a Capri fisher-girl. It struck TORVALD that, as I am a
    matron with three children, my performance might amuse the
    Consul's guests, and, at the same time, increase his connection
    at the Bank. TORVALD <i>is</i> so practical. (<i>To</i> Mrs.
    LINDEN, <i>who comes in with a large cardboard box.</i>) Ah,
    CHRISTINA, so you have brought in my old costume? <i>Would</i>
    you mind, as my husband's new Cashier, just doing up the
    trimming for me?</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. L.</i> Not at all&mdash;is it not part of my regular
    duties? (<i>Sewing.</i>) Don't you think, NORA, that you see a
    little too much of Dr. RANK?</p>

    <p><i>Nora</i>. Oh, I <i>couldn't</i> see too much of Dr. RANK!
    He <i>is</i> so amusing&mdash;always talking about his
    complaints, and heredity, and all sorts of indescribably funny
    things. Go away now, dear; I hear TORVALD. [Mrs. LINDEN
    <i>goes. Enter</i> TORVALD <i>from the Manager's room.</i> NORA
    <i>runs trippingly to him.</i></p>

    <p><i>Nora</i> (<i>coaxing</i>). Oh, TORVALD, if only you won't
    dismiss KROGSTAD, you can't think how your little lark would
    jump about and twitter!</p>

    <p><i>Helmer</i>. The inducement would be stronger but for the
    fact that, as it is, the little lark is generally engaged in
    that particular occupation. And I really <i>must</i> get rid of
    KROGSTAD. If I didn't, people would say I was under the thumb
    of my little squirrel here, and then KROGSTAD and I knew each
    other in early youth; and when two people knew each other in
    early youth&mdash;(<i>a short pause</i>)&mdash;h'm! Besides, he
    <i>will</i> address me as, "I say, TORVALD"&mdash;which causes
    me most painful emotion! He is tactless, dishonest, familiar,
    and morally ruined&mdash;altogether not at all the kind of
    person to be a Cashier in a Bank like mine.</p>

    <p><i>Nora</i>. But he writes in scurrilous papers,&mdash;he is
    on the staff of the Norwegian <i>Punch</i>. If you dismiss him,
    he may write nasty things about <i>you</i>, as wicked people
    did about poor dear Papa!</p>

    <p><i>Helmer</i>. Your poor dear Papa was not
    impeccable&mdash;far from it. I <i>am</i>&mdash;which makes all
    the difference. I have here a letter giving KROGSTAD the sack.
    One of the conveniences of living close to the Bank is, that I
    can use the housemaids as Bank-messengers. (<i>Goes to door and
    calls.</i>) ELLEN! (<i>Enter parlourmaid.</i>) Take that
    letter&mdash;there is no answer. (ELLEN <i>takes it and
    goes.</i>) That's settled&mdash;so now, NORA; as I am going to
    my private room, it will be a capital opportunity for you to
    practise the tambourine&mdash;thump away, little lark, the
    doors are double! [<i>Nods to her and goes in, shutting
    door.</i></p>

    <p><i>Nora</i> (<i>stroking her face</i>). How <i>am</i> I to
    get out of this mess! (<i>A ring at the Visitors' bell.</i>)
    Dr. RANK's ring! <i>He</i> shall help me out of it! (Dr. RANK
    <i>appears in doorway, hanging up his great-coat.</i>) Dear Dr.
    RANK, how <i>are</i> you? [<i>Takes both his hands.</i></p>

    <p><i>Rank</i> (<i>sitting down near the stove</i>). I am a
    miserable, hypochondriacal wretch&mdash;that's what <i>I</i>
    am. And why am I doomed to be dismal? Why? Because my father
    died of a fit of the blues! <i>Is</i> that fair&mdash;I put it
    to <i>you</i>?</p>

    <p><i>Nora</i>. Do try to be funnier than <i>that</i>! See, I
    will show you the flesh-coloured silk tights that I am to wear
    to-night&mdash;it will cheer you up. But you must only look at
    the feet&mdash;well, you may look at the rest if you're good.
    <i>Aren't</i> they lovely? Will they fit me, do you think?</p>

    <p><i>Rank</i> (<i>gloomily</i>). A poor fellow with both feet
    in the grave is not the best authority on the fit of silk
    stockings. I shall be food for worms before long&mdash;I
    <i>know</i> I shall!</p>

    <p><i>Nora</i>. You mustn't really be so frivolous! Take that!
    (<i>She hits him lightly on the ear with the stockings; then
    hums a little.</i>) I want you to do me a great service, Dr.
    RANK. (<i>Rolling up stockings</i>,) I always liked <i>you</i>.
    I love TORVALD most, of <i>course</i>&mdash;but, somehow, I'd
    rather spend my time with you&mdash;you <i>are</i> so
    amusing!</p>

    <p><i>Rank</i>. If I am, can't you guess why? (<i>A short
    silence.</i>) Because I love you! You can't pretend you didn't
    know it!</p>

    <p><i>Nora</i>. Perhaps not&mdash;but it was really too clumsy
    of you to mention it just as I was about to ask a favour of
    you! It was in the worst taste! (<i>With dignity.</i>) You must
    not imagine because I joke with you about silk stockings, and
    tell you things I never tell TORVALD, that I am therefore
    without the most delicate and scrupulous self-respect! I am
    really quite a good little doll, Dr. RANK, and
    now&mdash;(<i>sits in rocking-chair and smiles</i>)&mdash;now I
    shan't ask you what I was going to! [ELLEN <i>comes in with a
    card.</i></p>

    <p><i>Nora</i> (<i>terrified</i>). Oh, my goodness! [<i>Puts it
    in her pocket.</i></p>

    <p><i>Dr. Rank</i>. Excuse my easy Norwegian
    pleasantry&mdash;but&mdash;h'm&mdash;anything disagreeable
    up?</p>

    <p><i>Nora</i> (<i>to herself</i>). KROGSTAD's card! I must
    tell <i>another</i> whopper! (<i>To</i> RANK.) No. nothing,
    only&mdash;only my new costume. I want to try it on here. I
    always do try on my dresses in the drawing-room&mdash;it's
    <i>cosier</i>, you know. So go into TORVALD and amuse him till
    I'm ready. [RANK <i>goes into</i> HELMER's <i>room, and</i>
    NORA <i>bolts the door upon him, as</i> KROGSTAD <i>enters from
    hall in a fur cap.</i></p>

    <p><i>Krogs.</i> Well, I've got the sack, and so I came to see
    how <i>you</i> are getting on. I mayn't be a nice man,
    but&mdash;(<i>with feeling</i>)&mdash;I have a heart! And, as I
    don't intend to give up the forged I.O.U. unless I'm taken
    back, I was afraid you might be contemplating suicide, or
    something of that kind; and so I called to tell you that, if I
    were you, I wouldn't. Bad thing for the complexion, suicide,
    and silly, too, because it wouldn't mend matters in the least.
    (<i>Kindly.</i>) You must not take this affair too seriously.
    Mrs. HELMER. Get your husband to settle it amicably by taking
    me back as Cashier; <i>then</i> I shall soon get the whip-hand
    of <i>him</i>, and we shall all be as pleasant and comfortable
    as possible together!</p>

    <p><i>Nora</i>. Not even that prospect can tempt me! Besides,
    TORVALD wouldn't have you back at any price now!</p>

    <p><i>Krogs.</i> All right, then. I have here a letter, telling
    your husband all. I will take the liberty of dropping it in the
    letter-box at your hall-door as I go out. I'll wish you good
    evening! [<i>He goes out; presently the dull sound of a thick
    letter dropping into a wire box is heard.</i></p>

    <p><i>Nora</i> (<i>softly, and hoarsely</i>). He's done it! How
    <i>am</i> I to prevent TORVALD from seeing it?</p>

    <p><i>Helmer</i> (<i>inside the door, rattling</i>). Hasn't my
    lark changed its dress yet? (NORA <i>unbolts door</i>.)
    What&mdash;so you are <i>not</i> in fancy costume, after all?
    (<i>Enters with</i> RANK.) Are there any letters for me in the
    box there?</p>

    <p><i>Nora</i> (<i>voicelessly</i>). None&mdash;not even a
    postcard! Oh, TORVALD, don't, please, go and
    look&mdash;<i>promise</i> me you won't! I do <i>assure</i> you
    there isn't a letter! And I've forgotten the Tarantella you
    taught me&mdash;do let's run over it. I'm so afraid of breaking
    down&mdash;promise me not to look at the letter-box. I can't
    dance unless you do.</p>

    <p><i>Helmer</i> (<i>standing still, on his way to the
    letter-box</i>). I am a man of strict business habits, and some
    powers of observation; my little squirrel's assurances that
    there is nothing in the box, combined with her obvious anxiety
    that I should not go and see for myself, satisfy me that it is
    indeed empty, in spite of the fact that I have not invariably
    found her a strictly truthful little dicky-bird.
    There&mdash;there. (<i>Sits down to piano.</i>) Bang away on
    your tambourine, little squirrel&mdash;dance away, my own
    lark!</p>

    <p><i>Nora</i> (<i>dancing, with a long gay shawl</i>). Just
    <i>won't</i> the little squirrel! Faster&mdash;faster! Oh, I
    <i>do</i> feel so gay! We will have some champagne for dinner,
    <i>won't</i> we, TORVALD? [<i>Dances with more and more
    abandonment.</i></p>

    <p><i>Helmer</i> (<i>after addressing frequent remarks in
    correction</i>). Come, come&mdash;not this awful wildness! I
    don't like to see <i>quite</i> such a larky little lark as this
    ... Really it is time you stopped!</p>

    <p><i>Nora</i> (<i>her hair coming down as she dances more
    wildly still, and swings the tambourine</i>). I can't ... I
    can't! (<i>To herself, as she</i>

    <h2>TAKING THE CENSUS.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>A Story of the 6th of April, 1891.</i>)</h4>

        <a href="images/173.png"><img width="100%"

    </div>

    <p>As I have but a limited holding in the Temple, and,
    moreover, slept on the evening of the 5th of April at Burmah
    Gardens, I considered it right and proper to fill in the paper
    left me by the "Appointed Enumerator" at the latter address.
    And here I may say that the title of the subordinate officer
    intrusted with the addition of my household to the compilation
    of the Census pleased me greatly&mdash;"Appointed Enumerator"
    was distinctly good. I should have been willing (of course for
    an appropriate <i>honorarium</i>) to have accepted so
    well-sounding an appointment myself. To continue, the general
    tone of the instructions "to the Occupier" was excellent. Such
    words as "erroneous," "specification," and the like, appeared
    frequently, and must have been pleasant strangers to the
    householder who was authorised to employ some person other than
    himself to write, "if unable to do so himself." To be captious,
    I might have been better pleased had the housemaid who handed
    me the schedule been spared the smile provoked by finding me
    addressed by the "Appointed Enumerator" as "Mr. BEEFLESS,"
    instead of "Mr. BRIEFLESS." But this was a small matter.</p>

    <p>I need scarcely say that I took infinite pains to fill in my
    paper accurately. I have great sympathy with the "Census
    (England and Wales) Act, 1890," and wished, so far as I was
    personally concerned, to carry out its object to the fullest
    extent attainable. I had no difficulty about inserting my own
    "name and surname," and "profession or occupation." I rather
    hesitated, however, to describe myself as an "employer,"
    because the "examples of the mode of filling-up" rather
    suggested that domestic servants were not to count, and for the
    rest my share in the time of PORTINGTON, to say the least, is
    rather shadowy. For instance, I could hardly fairly suggest
    that in regard to the services of my excellent and admirable
    clerk, I am as great an employer of labour as, say, the head of
    a firm of railway contractors, or the managing director of a
    cosmopolitan hotel company. Then, although I am distinctly of
    opinion that I rightly carried out the intentions of the
    statute by describing myself as "the head of the family," my
    wife takes an opposite view of the question. In making the
    other entries, I had no great difficulty. The ages of my
    domestics, however, caused me some surprise. I had always
    imagined (and they have given me their faithful and valuable
    services I am glad to say for a long time) that the years in
    which they were born varied. But no, I was wrong. I found they
    were all of the same age&mdash;two-and-twenty. To refer to
    another class of my household&mdash;I described my son, SHALLOW
    NORTH BRIEFLESS (the first is an old family name of forensic
    celebrity, and the second an appropriate compliment to a
    distinguished member of the judicial Bench, whose courtesy to
    the Junior Bar is proverbial) as a "scholar," but rejected his
    (SHALLOW's) suggestion that I should add to the description of
    his brother (one of my younger sons, GEORGE LEWIS VAN TROMP
    CHESTER MOTE BOLTON BRIEFLESS&mdash;I selected his Christian
    names in anticipated recognition of possible professional
    favours to be conferred on him in after-life) the words
    "imbecile from his birth," as frivolous, untrue, and even
    libellous. We had but one untoward incident. In the early
    morning of Monday we found in our area a person who had
    evidently passed the night there in a condition of helpless
    intoxication. As she could offer no satisfactory explanation of
    her presence, I handed her over to the police, and entered her
    on the Census Paper as, "a supposed retired laundress,
    seemingly living on her own means, and apparently blind from
    the date of her last drinking-bout." I rejected advisedly her
    own indistinctly but frequently reiterated assertion that "she
    was a lady," because I had been warned by "the general
    instructions" to avoid such "indefinite terms as Esquire or
    Gentleman."</p>

    <p>As I wished to deliver my completed schedule to the
    "Appointed Enumerator" in person, I desired that he might be
    shown into my study when he called for the paper.</p>

    <p>"Excuse me, Sir," he said, after looking through the
    document at my request; "but you see there is a fine of a fiver
    for wilfully giving false information."</p>

    <p>"Yes," I returned, somewhat surprised at the suggestion;
    "and the proposed penalty has rendered me doubly anxious to be
    absolutely accurate. Do you notice any slip of the pen?"</p>

    <p>"Well, Sir," he answered, with some hesitation, "as the
    young chap who does the boots tells me that he has never heard
    of you having had a single brief while he's been with you, and
    that's coming three years, hadn't you better put 'retired'
    after 'Barrister-at-Law'? It will do no harm, and certingly
    would be safer!"</p>

    <p>Put "retired" after Barrister-at-Law! "Do no harm!" and be
    "safer!"</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>I silently intimated by a dignified gesture to the
    "Appointed Enumerator." that our interview was at an end, and
    then, taking my walking-stick with me, went in earnest and
    diligent search of "the young chap who does the boots!"</p>

    <h3>"UP, GUARDS, AND ACT 'EM!"</h3>

    <p>The "them" in this adapted quotation must be taken to mean
    "Burlesques;" and if these gay and lighthearted soldiers
    continue their histrionics as victoriously as they have done up
    to now, they will become celebrated as "The
    Grinny-diers-and-Burlesque-Line-Regiments." Private MCGREEVY,
    as a cockatoo, capital: his disguise obliterated him, but as
    Ensign and Lieutenant WAGGIBONE stealthily observed, "What the
    eye doesn't see, the heart doesn't MCGREEVY for." The music, by
    the talented descendant of Israel's wise King SOLOMON, was of
    course good throughout, and in the Cockatoo Duet better than
    ever. The ladies were exceptionally good. Mrs. CRUTCHLEY defied
    the omen of her name, which is not suggestive of dancing, and
    "Jigged away muchly Did Mrs. CRUTCHLEY." The Misses SAVILE
    CLARKE,&mdash;the Savilians among the Military,&mdash;were
    charming. Lieutenant NUGENT is an old hand at this, and his
    <i>Paul Prior</i> was not a whit behind his former
    performances. There's one more Guard O, Major RICARDO.
    <i>He</i> played <i>Crusoe</i>, And well did he do so! Three
    cheers for everybody! With the Guards' Burlesque, we fear no

    <p>PRESENTED AT COURT.&mdash;Acting upon the suggestions made
    in these columns a week ago, the Author of <i>The Volcano</i>,
    and the company of the Court Theatre have effected the most
    valuable alterations in the play of the evening. The Second Act
    now concludes with the interrupted singing of <i>The Wolf</i>,
    which brings down the Curtain with a roar of laughter, and the
    Third Act is also generally improved. Mrs. JOHN WOOD is seen at
    her best as the interviewing lady-journalist, which is
    condensing in a sentence a volume of praise. Mr. ARTHUR CECIL,
    as the Duke, is equally admirable; and Mr. WEEDON GROSSMITH,
    although scarcely in his element as a Member of Parliament of
    noble birth, is distinctly amusing. Altogether, <i>The
    Volcano</i> causes explosions of merriment in all parts of the
    house, and has entirely escaped the once-impending danger of
    fizzling out like a damp squib.</p>

    <h2>MICKY FREE IN PARIS.</h2>

    <p>As to the incident which recently appeared in the papers
    under the head-line "Insulting an Ambassador," our old friend
    MICKY writes us as follows:&mdash;"Be jabers then, ye must know
    the truth. Me and Count MUNSTER was drivin' together. The
    Count's every bit a true-born son of Ould Ireland for ever, and
    descended from the Kings of Munster by both sides, and more
    betoken wasn't he wearin' an Ulster at the very moment, and
    isn't he the best of chums with the Dukes of CONNAUGHT and
    LEINSTER? Any way we were in our baroosh passin' the time o'
    day to one another as we were drivin' in the Bore, when whack
    comes a loaf o' bread, shied at our heads by an unknown
    military blaygaird. It missed me noble friend, the Count, and,
    as if to give him a lesson in politeness, it just took off the
    hat of a domestic alongside the coachman on the box. 'Tunder
    and turf!' says I, preparing to descend, and give the
    scoundrels a taste of my blackthorn all round. 'Whist! be aisy
    now, MICKY,' says the Ambassador to me, in what is, betune
    ourselves, his own native tongue; and with that he picks up the
    loaf, sniffs at it, makes a wry face ('it's a rye loaf,' says
    I), and then says he, out loud, with a supercilious look,
    'Ill-bred!' Begorra, there was a whoop o' delight went up all
    round, which same was a sign of their purliteness, as divil a
    one of the ignoramuses could onderstand a wurrd the Court said
    in English or German, let alone Irish. 'Goot,' says MUNSTER to
    me, dropping into his German accent, which, on occasion, comes
    quite natural to him&mdash;the cratur! 'I'll give the loaf to
    the dog;' and he whistles up the mastiff, own brother to
    BISMARCK's. 'Eh, MICKY, ye gossoon, isn't the proverb, "Loaf
    me, loaf my dog"?' Ah! then was cheers for ould Ireland, and a
    mighty big dhrink entirely we had that same night.</p>

    offended. I thought my Article rather a moderate one. Quite
    true that I talk about falsehood, hypocrites, effrontery,
    demagogues, Pharisees, and so on; but expressions to be taken
    in strictly Pickwickian sense, and of course not intended for
    <i>you</i>.</p>

    <p><i>Eminent Writer to Editor</i>.&mdash;Explanation
    unsatisfactory. You first insert contribution, and then slate
    it. Do you call yourself an Editor?</p>

    <p><i>Editor to Eminent Writer</i>.&mdash;Rather think I
    <i>do</i> call myself Editor. Couldn't insert that humbug about

    <h2>"FACTA NON VERBA"; OR, PIERROT IN LONDON.</h2>

    <p>"Of the best! of the very best!" as ZERO or CIRO is
    perpetually affirming of everything eatable and drinkable that
    is for his own benefit and his customers' refreshment at the
    little bar, not a hundred miles from the Monte Carlo tables,
    where he himself and his barristers practise day and night;
    and, as this famous cutter of sandwiches and confectioner of
    drinks says of his stock in trade, so say we of <i>L'Enfant
    Prodigue</i>, which, having been translated by HORATIUS COCLES
    SEDGER from Paris to London, has gone straight to the heart and
    intelligence of our Theatre-loving public.</p>

             WHITE EXHIBITION.
    </div>

    <p>It is a subject for curious reflection that, just when the
    comic scenes of our English Pantomime have been crushed out by
    overpowering weight of gorgeous spectacle, there should
    re-appear in our midst a revival of the ancient <i>Pierrot</i>
    who pantomimed himself into public favour with the Parisians
    towards the close of the seventeenth century. Red-hot poker,
    sausages, and filching Clown have had their day, and lo! when
    everyone said we were tired of the "comic business" of
    Pantomime, here in our midst re-appear almost in their habits
    as they lived, certainly with their white faces and black
    skull-caps "as they appeared," a pair of marvellously clever
    Pierrots. Mlle. JANE MAY as <i>Pierrot Junior</i>, "the Prodigy
    son," and M. COURTÈS as <i>Pierrot Senior</i>, are already
    drawing the town to <i>Matinées</i> at the Prince of Wales's,
    causing us to laugh at them and with them in their joys, and to
    weep with them in their mimic sorrows. Yes! <i>Pierrot
    redivivus!</i></p>

    <p>Mind you, it is not a piece for children; make no mistake
    about that; <i>they</i> will only laugh at the antics, be
    ignorant of the story, and be untouched by its truth and
    pathos. All are good. We like the naughty <i>blanchisseuse</i>
    the least of the characters, and wish she had been <i>plus
    petite que ça</i>. But is it not in nature that the prodigal
    infant (veritable boy is Mlle. JANE MAY) should fall in love
    with a young woman some years his senior, and far beyond him in
    experience of the world? Why certainly. Then the Baron, played
    with great humour by M. LOUIS GOUGET, who wins the Mistress
    with his diamonds, and the inimitable Black Servant, M. JEAN
    ARCUEIL, who laughs at poor little <i>Pierrot</i>, and cringes
    to his wealthy rival and successor,&mdash;are they not both
    admirable? As for the acting of Madame SCHMIDT as <i>Madame
    Pierrot</i>, loving wife and devoted mother, it is, as it
    should be, "too good for words." Her pantomimic action is so
    sympathetic throughout, so&mdash;well, in fact, perfect. Who
    wants to hear them speak? <i>Facta non verba</i> is their
    motto. Yet with what <i>gusto</i> the Black, heavily bribed,
    mouths out the titled Baron's name, though never a syllable
    does he utter! It is all most excellent make-believe.</p>

    <p><i>Vive Pierrot à Londres!</i> We see him much the same as
    he was when he delighted the Parisians in 1830,&mdash;"<i>Avec
    sa grand casaque à gros boutons, son large pantalon flottant,
    ses souliers blancs comme le rests, son visage enfariné, sa
    tête couverte d'un serre-tête noir ... le véritable Pierrot
    avec sa bonhomie naïve ... ses joies d'enfant, et ses chagrins
    d'un effet si comique</i>"&mdash;and also so pathetic.</p>

    <p>If this entertainment could be given at night, the house
    would be crammed during a long run; but afternoon possibilities
    are limited. More than a word of praise must be given to M.
    ANDRÉ WORMSER's music, which, personally conducted by Mr.
    CROOK, goes hand in hand with the story written by MICHEL CARRÉ
    FILS, and illustrated by these clever pantomimists. No amateur
    of good acting should fail to see this performance. <i>Verb.
    sap.</i></p>

    <p>In the <i>Salon</i> this year, the <i>Athenæum</i> says, "a

    on the suggestion, and set aside one of the rooms in Burlington
    House as a Dormitory?</p>

    <p>Aha! special attraction in <i>The New Review</i>! "April

    cover that "<i>This number contains a Picture of</i> Miss ELLEN
    TERRY <i>in one of her earliest parts.</i>" Oh, dear! I wish it
    didn't contain this picture, which is a bleared red photograph
    of Misses KATE and ELLEN TERRY, "as they appeared" (as they
    never could appear, I'm sure) in an entertainment which
    achieved a great success in the provinces&mdash;but not with
    this red-Indian picture as a poster. Of course it may be
    intended as compliment-terry; it <i>may</i> mean "always
    entertaining and ever reddy." However, the picture is naught,
    except as a curiosity; but the first instalment of our ELLEN's
    reminiscences is delightfully written, because given quite
    naturally, just as the celebrated actress herself would
    dictate&mdash;(of course she never has to "dictate," as her
    scarcely-breathed wish is a law)&mdash;to her pleasantly-tasked
    amanuensis. Next lot, please!</p>

    <p>In <i>Macmillan's</i> for this month, ANDRÉ HOPE tells a
    fluttering tale in recounting "A Mystery of Old Gray's Inn." It
    would have come well from that weird old clerk, to whom <i>Mr.
    Pickwick</i> listened with interest during the convivialities
    at the "Magpie and Stump." It should take a prominent place in
    the proposed new issue of <i>Half Hours with Jumpy
    Authors</i>.</p>

    <p>The Baron has just read a delightful paper on "The Bretons
    at Home," by CHARLES G. WOOD, in the <i>Argosy</i>, for this
    month. The Baron who has been there, and still would go if he
    could, but, as he can't, he is contented to let "WOOD go"
    without him, and to read the latter's tales of a traveller.</p>

    <p><i>Turf Celebrities I have Known</i>, by WILLIAM DAY, is a
    gossipy, snarly sort of book; casting a rather murky or grey
    Day-light on a considerable number of Celebrities who were once
    on the turf, and are now under it. But the Baron not being
    himself either on the turf or under it, supposes that this DAY
    is an authority, as was once upon a time, that is, only the
    other day, the Dey of ALGIERS. But this DAY is not of Algiers,
    but of All-gibes. Ordinarily it is true that "Every dog has his
    day." Exceptions prove the rule, and it would appear from this
    book&mdash;"not the first 'book,' I suppose," quoth the Baron,
    "that Mr. DAY has 'made' or assisted in 'making,'"&mdash;that
    not every dog did <i>not</i> 'have' this particular Day, but
    that some dogs did. The writer has missed the chance of a good
    title&mdash;not for himself, but for his book. He should have
    it an autobiography, and then call it, "<i>De Die in Diem; or,
    Day by Day</i>."</p>

    <h4>(<i>A fragment from a Military-Commercial Romance of the

    <p>And so Mr. ELLERSDEE approached his proposed recruit, and
    invited him to lunch to discuss the matter quietly.</p>

    <p>"You are very good," returned the other, "but I can assure
    you I eat nothing before dinner. Won't you have a cigar?"</p>

    <p>Mr. ELLERSDEE accepted the proffered kindness, and remarked
    upon the excellent quality of the tobacco.</p>

    <p>"Yes," assented his companion, "it is not half bad, for we
    get all our supplies from the Stores; and now what can I do for
    you?"</p>

    <p>Then Mr. ELLERSDEE unfolded his sad story. England was
    losing her commercial prosperity, owing to a scarcity of
    labourers, artisans, nay, even clerks. The Empire was in as bad
    a condition as those foreign countries in which forced military
    service was established. Like France and Germany, trade was
    being ruined by the Army. Would not the young man desert, and
    become a recruit in the Labour League?</p>

    <p>"My dear friend," was the reply, "I hope I am as patriotic
    as most people, but I cannot sacrifice my just interest
    entirely to sentiment. What can you give me in exchange for my
    present life? I have recreation-rooms, libraries, polytechnics,
    and every sort of amusement?"</p>

    <p>"But also drill and discipline," urged the other.</p>

    <p>"Which I am told by my medical attendant (whose services by
    the way are gratuitous), are excellent for my health. This
    being so, I can scarcely complain of those institutions. Then I
    have excellent pay and ample food. Now, I ask you frankly, can
    the advantages offered by Trade compare for a moment with the
    privileges, as a soldier, I now enjoy? Tell me frankly, shall I
    improve my position by giving up the Army?"</p>

    <p>And Mr. ELLERSDEE was compelled to answer in the
    negative!</p>

    as the hills, but not quite so pointed; venerable, but broken
    down, and used up; not the Joke I used to be; once the rich
    darling of Society: but it (Society) didn't pay, so had to work
    hard for a living. <i>Tit Bits</i>, the <i>National
    Observer</i>, and the Chancery Judges, have impoverished me.
    Never mind&mdash;I'll be revenged&mdash;resolve to keep a
    Diary&mdash;"<i>weekly diary of a weakly</i>"&mdash;oh dear! my
    old infirmity again. Must really be more careful.</p>

    <p><i>April 2</i>.&mdash;In with the rest of them, for a
    (North-) Easter outing. HACKING, in the train, tried to palm me
    off upon HORNBLOWER, who had actually the impudence to affect
    that he "<i>couldn't see me</i>"; as if I hadn't obviously made
    his reputation for years! The best of it is, that HORNBLOWER is
    always airing me in public, and dropping me in private. Blow
    HORNBLOWER!</p>

    <p><i>April 3</i>.&mdash;Out to dinner. What a hypocrite
    Society is! Everyone pretended never to have heard me before. I
    was allotted to Miss HORNBLOWER (worse luck!) and she
    positively called me "Her own!"&mdash;at my age, too! It's
    indecent. Complained to HORNBLOWER, who now faced round, and
    maintained that he was the first to bring me out. I could
    almost have cried. No wonder I fell flat, and injured myself.
    Why, Sir, SIDNEY SMITH was my godfather, and was always
    trotting me out as a prodigy, and trading on me. I supported
    him, Sir, when I was but an infant phenomenon; I supported
    him&mdash;but I can't support HORNBLOWER.</p>

    <p><i>April 4</i>.&mdash;Went to the theatre, as I was told I
    figured in the play; claimed a free pass to the Stalls from the
    box-office boy, who was rude; showed him my card; he looked
    scared, and said it was all right. The actors were full of me:
    very gratifying; but everybody laughed! Just like their cheek!
    There's nothing laughable, I should fancy, about anything so
    played out as <i>I've</i> become. Ugh! how I detest
    irreverence! HORNBLOWER and HACKING have both written to the
    papers, maintaining that I belong to them, and that the theatre
    has no right to have me impersonated on the Stage; they term it
    "Thought Transference," "The Brain-Wave," or something
    outlandish; and to think that HACKING, who reviews HORNBLOWER's
    effusions, once spoke of me as stale! They had better not try
    my patience too far, I can tell them.</p>

    <p><i>April 5</i>.&mdash;<i>Sunday</i>. Want change, and rest.
    Made for the O'WILDE's sanctum. Cabman took the change, and
    O'WILDE the rest. Have known all the celebrities of the
    century, but like O'W. the most. For one so young, he's truly
    affable; made me quite at home; promised to put me up&mdash;or
    in, I forget which; and then he uttered this remarkable
    "preface"&mdash;"Jokes are neither old nor young: they are
    simply mine or thine&mdash;that is all." Nevertheless. I'm sure
    to be in his bad books before long.</p>

    <p><i>April 6</i>.&mdash;"Horrible outrage&mdash;an Old Joke,
    in trouble again"&mdash;so run the newspaper placards&mdash;was
    collared forcibly by two masked ruffians in Grub Street, and
    dispatched post-haste to <i>Punch</i> office. <i>Mr. P.</i>,
    however, had known me from a boy, and was not to be imposed
    upon. He sent me back promptly, on Her Majesty's Service,
    warning me that, unless I went off, I should probably be
    knocked on the head. Dear EVERGREEN POLICINELLO! but not so
    evergreen as all that. He knows my constitution won't stand
    these liberties. The desperadoes turn out to be HORNBLOWER and
    HACKING, as I suspected. In defence they alleged I had
    <i>struck</i> them forcibly! <i>Mr. P.</i> vows he'll proceed
    against them for nuisance&mdash;interfering with Ancient
    Lights.</p>

    <p><i>April 7</i>.&mdash;Very weak, from effects of yesterday.
    The heart taken out of me. Consult my Doctor. To judge from the
    prints in his waiting-room, I'm popular enough still with his
    patients. Says I'm suffering from a bad attack of Printer's
    Devils, but can't make me younger; replied that my desire was
    to be older. He looked grave, and rejoined, "Impossible";
    prescribed a course of Attic salts; as I came out, met Sir
    WILFRID LAWSON. He declares I don't look a day older than when
    he first knew me; but then, he's licensed to be sober on the
    premises! Ah, how I love the House of Commons!</p>

    <p><i>April 8</i>.&mdash;Worn to a skeleton; sinking fast, but
    I'll die hard. Make my will. Bequeath Autographs of TALLEYRAND
    and JOE MILLER to Madame Tussaud's; everything else to be sold
    for the foundation of an Asylum for Old Jokes. A knock at the
    door. Heaven help me!&mdash;<i>two</i> Interviewers! "Come in,"
    I said, with the conventional "cheery voice." Anticipated the
    worst, but worse than I anticipated. HORNBLOWER and HACKING are
    brooding over me; assert they have been sent by the LORD MAYOR.
    "Thought Transference" again! Well, I should have committed
    suicide, and now I can be released without crime. It won't last
    long. If I might suggest my obsequies, I should like to be
    cremated in Type. HACKING begs my blessing, and pretends to
    weep at hearing the last of me. Hope I shan't ever have to
    haunt HORNBLOWER!</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
